# Palindrom Echo – A Typing Garden

Palindrom Echo is a peaceful typing game where you resolve drifting “echoes” by typing their palindrome words. Inspired by the mechanic of typing away approaching words, the game reimagines the experience as a calm garden filled with floating forms and warm light.

## Features

- **Gentle gameplay** – no combat metaphors; you simply clear echoes to keep the garden harmonious.
- **Three difficulty tiers** – short, medium and long palindrome lists (all real English words) stored in `data-palindromes.js` for easy editing.
- **Responsive canvas engine** – smooth animation of drifting echoes with soft glows and subtle transitions.
- **Score & high‑score tracking** – localStorage remembers your best performance.
- **Keyboard‑first controls** – type letters, press **Esc** to pause/resume, and toggle sound via the speaker icons.
- **Desktop-first design** – on small screens, a gentle message recommends using a larger display.

## Running Locally

1. Clone or copy the project into a folder named `palindrom/typing_garden/` inside your GitHub Pages repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser to play locally. No build step or server is required.

## Deployment to GitHub Pages

1. Push the `palindrom/typing_garden/` folder to the root of your GitHub Pages repository.
2. Ensure that the published site serves `/palindrom/typing_garden/` (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/palindrom/typing_garden/`).
3. All assets are referenced with relative paths, so the game will work correctly from that subdirectory.

## Editing the Palindrome List

- Open `js/data-palindromes.js`.
- Modify the `short`, `medium`, or `long` arrays to add or remove palindrome words. Use only real English words and keep multi‑word phrases out of the lists.

## Customizing Design

- Colours, gradients and typography are defined in `css/styles.css` under the `:root` selector. Adjust those variables to tweak the palette or sizing.
- Copy and labels (hero text, game‑over messages, instructions) live in `index.html`. Edit them directly to change wording.

## Audio Notes

A minimal audio system generates soft sine tones for typing and word completion. Sound is off by default on some browsers; click the speaker icon to enable or disable audio. The game remains fully functional without sound.

## Desktop‑First Behaviour

Palindrom Echo is optimised for desktop play. When the window is narrower than 700px, the game and intro hide, and a message encourages using a larger screen. You can adjust this breakpoint in `css/styles.css` under the `@media` query.

Enjoy cultivating your typing garden!
